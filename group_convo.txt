* the main.cpp is super basic but functions. the main goal was only trying to read the data in and assign it to the matrix 
* ive had many issues with the template class but have got it to compile with out error but haven't implemented it 

get_trucks(double gas, int served)
{
  function:
  function:
  function:
  function:
  function:
  function:

}


the swap variable gets removed later when we do multilayer pathfinding

Needed

(2) add virtual to derived 

(3) find nearest gas station *not working yet*
  -go to gas station 
  - use that as new starting point so not [0,0] as implimented 

(4) get user input and call algo based on user input 
 two valid function calls

 path_find_g(gas,capacity,matrix,start,SIZE); 
 path_find_s(gas,capacity,matrix,start,SIZE);

I think this is done

(5)animation
